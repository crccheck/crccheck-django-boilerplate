Disclaimer
----------

These are my personal boilerplates for Django apps and projects. These are
*very* opinionated and inspiration is given when I can recall. If you have a
large project, these boilerplates will not work. For example, these settings
are in one ``settings.py``, but for a large project, you'll most likely use a
settings module.
