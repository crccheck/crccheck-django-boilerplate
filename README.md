This Project Is Not PIP Installable! There is a setup.py, but it is a trick!
References to VERSION are also a lie. Defaults to APL2 license.

Boilerplate for starting a standalone django app + example-slash-testing project that is Heroku-ready.


Setup
-----

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
